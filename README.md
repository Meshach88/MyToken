# MyToken
A simple smart contract for a token.
This Solidity program is a simple smart contract for a token. It demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to create a token with basic features like the token name, token abbreviation, total supply, mint and burn functions.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has the following state variables; token name, token abbreviation, total supply and two functions to mint and burn tokens.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Token.sol). Copy and paste the code in MyToken.sol (the solidity file in this repository)

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the contract you want to deploy from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint function and the burn function. Click on the "MyToken" contract (or whatever name is the solidity file you created) in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "mint" or "burn" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the functions. You need to try the functions at separate times. You start by minting to get some tokens and increase the supply before trying the burn some of them.
